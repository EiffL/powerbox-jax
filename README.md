# powerbox-jax
`powerbox` + `Jax` ... like PB&J, an ideal combo

Jax implementation of `powerbox` (https://github.com/steven-murray/powerbox) for autodifferentiability.
 `powerbox-jax` is functionally equivalent to `powerbox`, but is now fully differentiable and XLA-compatible !

## installation

For installation on the command line or Colab, call

`pip install git+https://github.com/tlmakinen/powerbox-jax.git`


# example: generate a differentiable mock dark matter field
